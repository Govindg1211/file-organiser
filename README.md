File Organizer Project Description:
The File Organizer is a Python application designed to help users efficiently manage and organize their files within a specified directory. This application categorizes files into different types such as Videos, Audios, Documents, and Miscellaneous, based on their extensions.

Key Features:
Directory Input: Users can specify the directory where the files they want to organize are located.
File Type Selection: Users can select which types of files they want to organize (e.g., Videos, Audios, Documents) and can also choose to move files that do not fit into these categories into a "Miscellaneous" folder.
Automatic Folder Creation: The application automatically creates folders for each selected file type if they do not already exist.
File Movement: The program moves files from the specified directory into their respective folders based on their file extensions.
User-Friendly Interface: The application features a graphical user interface (GUI) built with Tkinter, making it easy for users to interact with.

Prerequisites:
Before running the File Organizer application, ensure you have the following:
Python: Make sure Python is installed on your machine (preferably Python 3.x).
Tkinter: This library is included with standard Python installations, but if you're using a minimal installation, you might need to install it separately.
Operating System Compatibility: The script is designed to work on both Windows and Unix-like systems (Linux/Mac).

Required Libraries:
The following libraries are used in this project:
os: This module provides a way of using operating system-dependent functionality like reading or writing to the file system.
tkinter: This module is used for creating the GUI of the application.
tkinter.messagebox: This submodule is used for displaying message boxes to inform the user about success or errors.
tkinter.PhotoImage: This class is used for handling images in the GUI.

Conclusion:
The File Organizer project is a practical tool for anyone looking to declutter their digital workspace by automatically sorting files into designated folders based on their types. With its user-friendly interface and straightforward functionality, users can quickly organize their files without hassle.
